# Audio Files for Jake's Birthday Website

This directory should contain the following audio file:

## birthday.mp3
This should be a background music file that plays when the user clicks the surprise button.
Recommended options:
- A chipper instrumental
- A playful lo-fi beat
- A birthday-themed song (just be mindful of copyright)

## Audio Sources
You can find royalty-free music on sites like:
- Free Music Archive: https://freemusicarchive.org/
- Bensound: https://www.bensound.com/
- YouTube Audio Library: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary

## File Format
- MP3 format is recommended for broad browser compatibility
- Keep file size reasonable (under 5MB) for faster loading
- Duration of 1-3 minutes is ideal (the audio will loop)

## Placeholder
Until you add your own audio file, the website will attempt to play the background music but it won't work. The rest of the site will function normally.
