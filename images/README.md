# Image Files for Jake's Birthday Website

This directory should contain the following image files:

## cat-party.gif
This should be an animated GIF of a cat wearing a party hat or a retro techy celebration.
You can find free GIFs on sites like:
- Giphy: https://giphy.com/
- Tenor: https://tenor.com/
- Or create your own!

## Recommended Image Sizes
- For the cat GIF: Approximately 300-400px wide for optimal display in the modal
- Keep file sizes small (under 1MB if possible) for faster loading

## Placeholder
Until you add your own images, the website will attempt to load the cat-party.gif file but it won't display. The rest of the site will function normally.
